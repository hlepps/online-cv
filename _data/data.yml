    Hi, my name is Piotr, I'm a young C# and Unity programmer - that means I have experience in programming various games in Unity but I have also used C# outside of the game engine, creating apps in, for example, WPF and WinForms. 
    Currently, I'm in my sixth semester of studies (out of seven).

        My Engineering Thesis, a 3D game in Unity.
        The topic is: Implementation of a procedural algorithm for generating three-dimensional terrains that can be modified in real time in the form of a computer game.

        Work in progress. Current features:
        + Simple cave generation system using combination of Simplex noises
        + Implementation of Marching Cubes algorithm using compute shaders (Very fast, everything calculated on graphics card)
        + Ability to modify terrain in real time

        App written in C#, WPF.
        It is a software used by stair makers to help with their work at designing stairs and staircases. It's main function is to fetch data from the measuring device and process it so it will be usable in staircase design software. In addition to it, it has couple additional functions that make the work cheaper and quicker by many hours per project.

    Although I am young, I am already quite experienced in working with Unity. I've stumbled upon many bugs, complicated tasks and obstacles that I overcome, and I'm eager to experience even more.
    My favorite tasks and jobs are those during which I can learn something new and interesting, for example new genre of a game, unique feature, or something that for some reason will gain my interest.
    Beside Unity, I'm open to explore new engines and frameworks, I've used Unreal Engine, Godot, Clickteam Fusion, SFML, Raylib and some more for small projects, but Unity is my all-time favorite.
